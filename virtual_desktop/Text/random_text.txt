- Once upon a boot, UNIX ran init. As a result, the mighty Wizard of OS read
    an ancient scroll of wisdom which told him how many magical terminals to
    run and that he should split one process per terminal

  the prophecy, destined to login into the machine, began.
- Time passed, centuries and millennia washed over the wizard, turning his
  beard white with CPU ticks of generations past, but faith smiled upon him,
  as his quest came to an interrupt. The One came into being, and with the power
  bestowed upon him, he executed a Shell to accept commands and carry his
  will, and blessed it so that it can open more processes than the Law courts
  of the world have seen.

without warning, we released the inferno.
without warning, we knocked on the door.

and there. it. stood.
at first, he looked confused. then, perceiving that he was surrounded, he regained his composure and groaned to us: 'next week, i said next week'.
so we left
